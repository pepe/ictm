OMG I had to wake up at 5am, just before I was leaving the home, I found out
I do not have my wallet. Frantical search ensued.

Then in the bus, I sat on the wrong place, and have been moved by its right
owner.

Then everything was OK, we agreed on merge of the classes and I talked about
[People](/ictm/assets/ICT-for-Managers-wednesday.pdf) in the organization.

But with the second group, I actually get little bit lost in the debate, and
have to be called out by Annicka Pries. Happy it ended like this.
